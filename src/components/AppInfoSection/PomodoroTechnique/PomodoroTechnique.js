      <h2>What is Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
      <p>
        The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more
        productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break
        down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated
        by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian
        word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo
        used as a university student. - Wikipedia
