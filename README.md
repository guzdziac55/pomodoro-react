# Welcome to PomodoroApp !

Hi ! I am David. I wrote a copy of the well-known and liked application pomodoroFocus. The pomodoro app allows you to focus more on productive work. You can personalize your settings and monitor your most frequent activities.
Find out more below.

# Demo link:

[PomodoroApp](https://react-http-b5eef.web.app/)

## Overview

The application was written for educational purposes. I am a novice programmer who is eager to learn new technologies. As I used this application on a daily basis, I decided to write it myself from scratch using React and its new features.

## Features

- Creating a to-do list.
- Creating notes for to-do tasks.
- Stopwatch for work control.
- Three work modes that automatically calculate when you should take a break.
- More settings such as (notification sounds, mode times, automation)
  dynamic theme.
- Creating user accounts.
- Create TaskList Templates.
- Login system.
- Storing data locally with the possibility of creating an account and storing data on the server.
- Responsive design.
- User Avatar picker using external API.

## Technologies

#### Project is created with:

- React v17 (using Hooks).
- Redux ( with toolkit ) .
- React Router v6.
- LocalStorage with persist library.
- Framer Motion - animations.
- Firebase (data manage) - realtimeDatabase & auth.
- React-Toastify - for notifications.
- Css modules for styling.

## What could be done better

#### A list of things that the current one I could be able to improve:

- better props passing to child components.
- firebase main state should be done with objects => firebase convert empty arrays for falsy values.
- many smaller components, greater reusability.
- not implementing scss from the very beginning.
- more later ...
